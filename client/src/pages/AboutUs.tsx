            <p className='mx-auto mb-4 text-3xl text-center font-semibold mt-16'>Fueling Your Every Move </p>
            <p className='text-center mx-auto w-11/12'>Founded in 2018 by lifelong athlete and designer Jake Lin, Shoppy began as a small passion project in a garage â€” with a single mission:

                <span className='text-orange-500 font-bold text-lg'>{' '}To create performance-driven sportswear that empowers people to move freely and confidently.{' '}</span> 
                Jake believed that great athletic gear shouldn't just be for professionals. It should be for everyone who moves â€” runners, gym-goers, hikers, cyclists, and weekend adventurers. What started with a few prototypes of lightweight running shoes quickly grew into a full line of high-performance footwear, apparel, socks, and backpacks, now trusted by thousands.
